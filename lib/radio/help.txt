```
USAGE: radio [host] [action] [service...] [[key]:[value]...]
```

## host

The host is just any valid DNS entry or IP address.  We need to know who to talk to.  If
your API lives in a context path like `/api` you can append that to the host argument too

## action

Actions will determine the HTTP method to use, in addition to the standard HTTP methods
there are also some aliases you can use

- `show` translates to `GET`
- `new` translates to `POST`
- `update` translates to `PUT`

Any action that matches an HTTP method name will be converted to uppercase, so you don't
have to type `DELETE` on the CLI, `delete` will work just fine

## endpoint

The service is the API service you want to perform your action on.  You can specify the
service either `/` delimited or space delimited.  I like space delimited becayse
it looks nicer.  For example if I have an endpoint `GET /jobs/23/status` would
run

````bash
$ radio api.ht.gs get jobs/23/status
{
  "percent": 23,
  "status": "running"
}

# or just replace the slashes with spaces

$ radio api.ht.gs get jobs 23 status
{
  "percent": 23,
  "status": "running"
}
```
